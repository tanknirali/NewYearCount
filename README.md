This is a New Year Countdown clock which will display "Happy New Year" at the end of year 2016.

I spend 45 min to do this exercise.
I chose JavaScript, HTML and CSS for doing this exercise. 
I chose these tools because I am more comfortable in working them in the given time period.
I would like to enhance the UI of this project by adding some graphics or animations.
